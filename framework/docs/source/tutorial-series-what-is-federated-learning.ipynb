        "\n",
        "This classical machine learning approach we've just seen can be used in some cases. Great examples include categorizing holiday photos, or analyzing web traffic. Cases, where all the data is naturally available on a centralized server.\n",

        "\n",
        "But the approach can not be used in many other cases. Cases, where the data is not available on a centralized server, or cases where the data available on one server is not enough to train a good model.\n",
        "\n",
        "<div style=\"max-width:50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n",

        "</div>\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many reasons why the classical centralized machine learning approach does not work for a large number of highly important real-world use cases. Those reasons include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Regulations**: GDPR (Europe), CCPA (California), PIPEDA (Canada), LGPD (Brazil), PDPL (Argentina), KVKK (Turkey), POPI (South Africa), FSS (Russia), CDPR (China), PDPB (India), PIPA (Korea), APPI (Japan), PDP (Indonesia), PDPA (Singapore), APP (Australia), and other regulations protect sensitive data from being moved. In fact, those regulations sometimes even prevent single organizations from combining their own users' data for machine learning training because those users live in different parts of the world, and their data is governed by different data protection regulations.\n",
        "- **User preference**: In addition to regulation, there are use cases where users just expect that no data leaves their device, ever. If you type your passwords and credit card info into the digital keyboard of your phone, you don't expect those passwords to end up on the server of the company that developed that keyboard, do you? In fact, that use case was the reason federated learning was invented in the first place.\n",
        "- **Data volume**: Some sensors, like cameras, produce such a high data volume that it is neither feasible nor economic to collect all the data (due to, for example, bandwidth or communication efficiency). Think about a national rail service with hundreds of train stations across the country. If each of these train stations is outfitted with a number of security cameras, the volume of raw on-device data they produce requires incredibly powerful and exceedingly expensive infrastructure to process and store. And most of the data isn't even useful.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples where centralized machine learning does not work include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Sensitive healthcare records from multiple hospitals to train cancer detection models.\n",
        "- Financial information from different organizations to detect financial fraud.\n",
        "- Location data from your electric car to make better range prediction.\n",
        "- End-to-end encrypted messages to train better auto-complete models.\n",
        "\n",
        "The popularity of privacy-enhancing systems like the [Brave](https://brave.com/) browser or the [Signal](https://signal.org/) messenger shows that users care about privacy. In fact, they choose the privacy-enhancing version over other alternatives, if such an alternative exists. But what can we do to apply machine learning and data science to these cases to utilize private data? After all, these are all areas that would benefit significantly from recent advances in AI."

We can build novel privacy-enhancing applications (such as secure messaging) that have better built-in AI than their non-privacy-enhancing alternatives. And those are just a few of the examples that come to mind. As we deploy Federated Learning, we discover more and more areas that can suddenly be reinvented because they now have access to vast amounts of previously inaccessible data.\n",

        "### Federated learning in five steps\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 0: Initialize global model\n",
        "\n",
        "We start by initializing the model on the server. This is exactly the same in classic centralized learning: we initialize the model parameters, either randomly or from a previously saved checkpoint.\n",
        "\n",

        "</div>\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 1: Send model to a number of connected organizations/devices (client nodes)\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we send the parameters of the global model to the connected client nodes (think: edge devices like smartphones or servers belonging to organizations). This is to ensure that each participating node starts its local training using the same model parameters. We often use only a few of the connected nodes instead of all nodes. The reason for this is that selecting more and more client nodes has diminishing returns.\n",
        "\n",
        "<div style=\"max-width:50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Step 2: Train model locally on the data of each organization/device (client node)\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that all (selected) client nodes have the latest version of the global model parameters, they start the local training. They use their own local dataset to train their own local model. They don't train the model until full convergence, but they only train for a little while. This could be as little as one epoch on the local data, or even just a few steps (mini-batches).\n",
        "\n",
        "<div style=\"max-width:50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n",

        "</div>\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 3: Return model updates back to the server\n",
        "\n",
        "After local training, each client node has a slightly different version of the model parameters they originally received. The parameters are all different because each client node has different examples in its local dataset. The client nodes then send those model updates back to the server. The model updates they send can either be the full model parameters or just the gradients that were accumulated during local training.\n",
        "\n",
        "<div style=\"max-width:50%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n",

        "</div>\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 4: Aggregate model updates into a new global model\n",
        "\n",
        "The server receives model updates from the selected client nodes. If it selected 100 client nodes, it now has 100 slightly different versions of the original global model, each trained on the local data of one client. But didn't we want to have one model that contains the learnings from the data of all 100 client nodes?\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to get one single model, we have to combine all the model updates we received from the client nodes. This process is called *aggregation*, and there are many different ways to do it. The most basic way is called *Federated Averaging* ([McMahan et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629)), often abbreviated as *FedAvg*. *FedAvg* takes the 100 model updates and, as the name suggests, averages them. To be more precise, it takes the *weighted average* of the model updates, weighted by the number of examples each client used for training. The weighting is important to make sure that each data example has the same \"influence\" on the resulting global model. If one client has 10 examples, and another client has 100 examples, then - without weighting - each of the 10 examples would influence the global model ten times as much as each of the 100 examples.\n",

        "</div>\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 5: Repeat steps 1 to 4 until the model converges\n",
        "\n",
        "Steps 1 to 4 are what we call a single round of federated learning. The global model parameters get sent to the participating client nodes (step 1), the client nodes train on their local data (step 2), they send their updated models to the server (step 3), and the server then aggregates the model updates to get a new version of the global model (step 4).\n",
        "\n",
        "During a single round, each client node that participates in that iteration only trains for a little while. This means that after the aggregation step (step 4), we have a model that has been trained on all the data of all participating client nodes, but only for a little while. We then have to repeat this training process over and over again to eventually arrive at a fully trained model that performs well across the data of all client nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "Congratulations, you now understand the basics of federated learning. There's a lot more to discuss, of course, but that was federated learning in a nutshell. In later parts of this tutorial, we will go into more detail. Interesting questions include: How can we select the best client nodes that should participate in the next round? What's the best way to aggregate model updates? How can we handle failing client nodes (stragglers)?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Federated Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "Just like we can train a model on the decentralized data of different client nodes, we can also evaluate the model on that data to receive valuable metrics. This is called federated evaluation, sometimes abbreviated as FE. In fact, federated evaluation is an integral part of most federated learning systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Federated Analytics\n",
        "\n",
        "In many cases, machine learning isn't necessary to derive value from data. Data analysis can yield valuable insights, but again, there's often not enough data to get a clear answer. What's the average age at which people develop a certain type of health condition? Federated analytics enables such queries over multiple client nodes. It is usually used in conjunction with other privacy-enhancing technologies like secure aggregation to prevent the server from seeing the results submitted by individual client nodes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Differential Privacy\n",
        "\n",
        "Differential privacy (DP) is often mentioned in the context of Federated Learning. It is a privacy-preserving method used when analyzing and sharing statistical data, ensuring the privacy of individual participants. DP achieves this by adding statistical noise to the model updates, ensuring any individual participants‚Äô information cannot be distinguished or re-identified. This technique can be considered an optimization that provides a quantifiable privacy protection measure."
